# Resume

This is my resume using [elipapa/markdown-cv](https://github.com/elipapa/markdown-cv) template, with substantial edits on the CSS.

# Usage

You are free to use this template. You do not need permission from me.

However, as a courtesy, if you are using my edits, please either fork from my fork, or state it on the README. There is no need to attribute in the rendered resume (otherwise all usages of resume templates would need to do this).

# How to use

You make a fork from my fork (which contains my CSS edits), publish as Github Pages and edit the `index.md`. Please refer to the [base repository](https://github.com/elipapa/markdown-cv) for step-by-step details.

Please see the [differences](https://github.com/elipapa/markdown-cv/compare/master...tonghuikang:main) that I have made with the elipapa/markdown-cv.


# Why do I use this

Due to a phenomenon called [regression toward the mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean), every time after I update my [Codeforces rating](https://codeforces.com/profile/huikang) on my resume, my rating drops. I would want a solution that automatically updates my Codeforces rating. This is the simplest solution that I could engineer.

Moreover, I would like to provide information of varying degree for different recipients. If you provide the [correct passcode](https://resume.huikang.dev/?passcode=classics) you may get my contact information, among other more personal information.


# Alternative Solutions

When you are deciding on the resume template to use, these are the benchmarks that you can easily use. These templates are from the pinned messages from the resume channel in cscareers.dev Discord server.

- [Jake's Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) Overleaf Template for WYSIWYM editing
- [Resumake](https://resumake.io/) for making a resume without installing or signing up for anything.

If you want to use a different template, make sure it is least as good as the templates above. With these templates, you will only need to be concerned with the content.

Most applications will first go through an automated resume filter. To pass the filter, the parser needs to be able to extract important information from the resume. You can try using the parser [here](https://itsjafer.com/#/parser).

The templates from the Discord channel has been touted to be accurately parsed by most major resume parsers.

Please be aware of which parties will you be sending your private information to. You are advised to do your research.


# Should you use my template

Unless you obsess over the display of accurate competitive programming ratings, or a simple solution on sharing your web resume with varying privacy settings, I think you should just use the templates from the Discord channel.

Otherwise, feel free to use my template!
